Notes:

Domain is registered through squarespace

gh-pages branch may be important? There is a cname file that seems important on that branch but it may be stale since deploys are through github actions. Check docs for more info

Github Pages docs aren't great, so if you need to reconfigure consult google/chatgpt

Deploys are handle through github actions on push to main branch
